GitHub has better security features compared with dropbox as in the form of two-factor authentication for internet banking. 
The user can enable two-factor authentication to send them a one-time-password(OTP) to their phone. 
The user will get a OTP whenever someone try to sign into their account. 
Due to this feature, only those who has both password and OTP can sign into the account.
